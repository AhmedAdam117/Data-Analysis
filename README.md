Sales Dashboard Project - Café
Overview
This project aims to create a sales dashboard for a café chain with three different branches. 
The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the café's sales performance, identify trends, and highlight areas for
improvement in terms of profitability, best-selling products, and peak times.

Analyze sales by time: Identify the best days, hours, and months for sales.
Branch comparison: Evaluate the performance of the three branches and detect any significant differences.

The following steps were undertaken to ensure the data was ready for analysis:

Data cleaning: Removed duplicate entries and corrected inconsistent data types.
Data transformation: Added new columns for day, month, and hour to allow for detailed time-based analysis.
Profit Calculation: A new column was created to track profits for each sale.
Tools and Techniques Used
Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to merge and analyze the data effectively.
Data Analysis: Used pivot tables to extract key insights about sales performance.
